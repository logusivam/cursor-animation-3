# Cursor Animation: Dot with Outline Circle using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

This project demonstrates how to create a custom cursor animation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The custom cursor consists of a small dot with an outline circle that follows the cursor movement, providing a dynamic and visually engaging effect. This animation enhances the user experience by making cursor interactions more interesting and visually appealing.

## Features

- **Custom Cursor**: Replaces the default cursor with a small dot and an outline circle.
- **Smooth Movement**: The outline circle smoothly follows the cursor movement.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on different screen sizes and devices.

## Installation

To use this project, simply download or clone the repository:

Alternatively, you can directly copy the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files into your project directory.

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to see the custom cursor animation in action.

## Example
